Explain the largest common subsequence problem 

it ask the logest common subsequence between two sprites. you can solve this recursively with memoization (and optimal subproblems) at O(mn) time. If the last value of two strings are the same, then the answer is L(n,m) = L(n-1,m-1) + 1. If tMake sure to have a cache, or else the time complexity will be 2 to the n

What is a higher order componenet? 

An advanced technique in React for reusing componenet logic. They take a wrapped componeent and create a new componeent, passing in needed data. 

What is a higher order function? 

A function that does at least one of the following: 

takes one or more functions as arguments 
returns a function as its result 

Explain longest increasing subsequece problem 

Dynamic program solution: O(n^2):
nest loops with another array that mentions that largest increasign sbubsequence as you're going through.
Patience sort solution O(nlogn)

What are render props? 


remder props refers to a simple technique for sharing code between react compoenets using a props whose value is a function. A component with a render prop takes a function taht returns a react eleemnt and calls it instead of implementing its own render logic.
